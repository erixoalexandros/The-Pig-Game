Title: The Pig Game

Game rules:

To play you'll need 2 players. You win by being the first player to score 100 or more points. Player 1 go first. The player throws a die and scores as many points as the total shown on the Current score. The player may continue rolling and accumulating points (but risk rolling a 1) or end his turn pressing Hold!. If the player rolls a 1 his turn is over, he loses all points he accumulated that turn, and he passes the die to the next player. Play passes from player to player until a winner is determined.
